#summary How to run the CFAST Verification Suite.

= Introduction =

These are preliminary notes on how to run the CFAST Verification Suite. The Suite consists of input files that are designed to test
various CFAST routines. .

All of the input files are located in the Verification diretory of the CFAST repository. The routines used to automate this process are either shell scripts that are appropriate for a Unix, Linux or OSX operating system or ".bat" files for a Windows/DOS computer.

= Required Software =

  * Subversion client
  * LaTeX, preferably PDF-LaTeX.

= Initial Tasks =

The process has a number of prerequisite steps:
  # Check out the entire CFAST Repository [AccessingSubversionRepository using these instructions], or update your current repository to the latest revision.
  # Compile CFAST by running the "make_cfast" scripts in the appropriate directory under the CFAST directory.

= Running the Cases =

  # cd to the Verification/scripts directory of the Repository.
  # At the command prompt, type: `./Run_CFAST_Cases.sh`
  
= Processing the Output =

  # cd to the Verification/scripts directory of the Repository.
  # Type `./Make_CFAST_Pictures.sh` (Linux/Unix) or execute `Make_CFAST_Pictures.bat` (Windows). This should automatically generate the Smokeview pictures.
